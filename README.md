🌾 SmartCrop-AI: AI-Based Plant Disease Detection
🧩 Problem Statement

Agriculture plays a crucial role in ensuring food security, but plant diseases lead to major crop losses worldwide. Farmers often lack tools to identify early symptoms, causing delays in treatment and reduced yield.
There is a strong need for an AI-powered system that can automatically detect and classify plant diseases from leaf images, supporting sustainable and healthy farming practices.

🎯 Aim

To develop a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based image classification model that can accurately detect and differentiate plant leaf diseases using image data.

🌍 Relevance to Sustainability

This project supports UN Sustainable Development Goal 2 – Zero Hunger and Goal 12 – Responsible Consumption and Production by promoting precision agriculture and reducing crop waste.
