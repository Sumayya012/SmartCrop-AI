# 🌾 SmartCropAI: Plant Disease Detection using Deep Learning

## ⭐ Overview
**SmartCropAI** is an AI-based system designed to identify **15 common plant leaf diseases** from images using **Transfer Learning with MobileNetV2**.  
Built as part of an **AI Internship Program**, this project demonstrates real-world application of deep learning in agriculture — enabling early crop disease detection and improved yield.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. **Input:** Leaf image captured by the user.  
2. **Processing:** Image is preprocessed (resized, normalized).  
3. **Model:** Processed through a fine-tuned **MobileNetV2 CNN**.  
4. **Output:** Model predicts the disease class with confidence score.
