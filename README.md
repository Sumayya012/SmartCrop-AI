# 🌾 SmartCropAI — Plant Disease Detection using Deep Learning

## ⭐ Overview
**SmartCropAI** is an AI-powered plant leaf disease classification system built using **Transfer Learning (MobileNetV2)**.  
Developed under the **AI for Green Skills & Sustainability Internship Program**, this project demonstrates how artificial intelligence can support agriculture by enabling early disease detection and improving crop productivity.
